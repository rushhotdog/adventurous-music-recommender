# Be Adventurous, A Music Recommender
Are you tired of listening to the same type of music over and over but don't know where to find anything different? This new application will take you out of your musical rut and bring you to something that's not the style you're used to, but with a higher probability of you liking it!

### Background
- Americans are spending on average more than 4.5 hours a day (32.1 hours per week) listening to music, says Nielsen in releasing new data on music consumption. 
- According to a survey by Deezer, 18.8 percent of respondents stated that they sought out music that was new to them on a daily basis, and 6.4 percent said that they never actively looked for new music outside their favorite genre.
- I discovered many of my favorite musicians and bands that have kept me company and inspired me just by listening to random songs back in high school. Recently, it occured to me just how much time I spend listening to the same type of music over and over again on a daily basis. Honestly, it made me really miss the days where I would just go on an music adventure without any expectations. Most of the times I just find songs that I couldn't to get into. But every once in a while, I get to find something that I can come to love and understand. That whole journey was really something and I want to encourage people to go out and experience this kind of adventure. 

### Data
For this project, I used [Amazon user reviews of digital music purchase](https://nijianmo.github.io/amazon/index.html). The dataset contains 233.1 million reviews ranging from May 1996 to Oct 2018. 

Here are some of the most rated songs in the dataset:
